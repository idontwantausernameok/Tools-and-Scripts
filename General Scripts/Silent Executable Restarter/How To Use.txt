Just don't use it.
This script is from Windows XP era, there are better ways to do this.
But if for some reason you absolutely want or have to use it, well, do it.

Put the 2 files at the source of your exectuable.
Edit the Batch file and replace all the "EXECUTABLE_NAME" fields with the name of your exectuable.
Run the VBScript to silently start the Executable and the batch file which will restart your server after 3 seconds of it crashing.

To Shut down the restarter, open the Task Manager and stop cmd.exe, and hope to hit the right one! (Uses about 4000K RAM)
